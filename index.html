      		<h2 id="about">About me</h2>

      			<p>Hello World! My name is Natasa and I am in love with coding for a while now. I was one of the 800 people that got the opportunity to get a scholarship from the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government. During that period I managed to learn basic programming principles, Java, SQL and other. Also of note are two workshops where we learned basics of JSF and ADF. Before my real coding experience, I have experimented with HTML and CSS on my own through tutorials on different websites, and I have attended a web programming course in StatIt center, Inđija.</p>
      			<p>Besides learning how to code in my spare time I like to dance salsa with my friends, read books, and spend as much time as I can be surrounded by kids and animals. I was a volunteer for the National Red Cross, editor for school papers and one of the cheerleaders in the national team of Serbia. In my previous job positions, I have mostly worked in a team and I really liked it, but I can also work independently as well..</p>
